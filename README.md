A Webradio for the kitchen based on the Raspberry PI. [Go watch it in action!](https://vimeo.com/171646691)

The documentation can be found [here](https://studentkittens.github.io/eulenfunk/eulenfunk-doc.pdf).
Some slides [are available too](https://studentkittens.github.io/eulenfunk/index.html).

Sadly, both are in german. We're happy to answer questions though.
